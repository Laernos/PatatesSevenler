This repository contains a collection of custom commands for the Yagpdb Discord bot, created by me. These commands are intended to be used with the Yagpdb bot and are written using the Yagpdb Custom Command syntax.

## Installation
To use these custom commands, you will need to have the Yagpdb bot added on your Discord server. Once you have added the bot, you can add the custom commands to your server by following these steps:

1. Open the [Yagpdb Control](https://yagpdb.xyz/manage) Panel.
2. Click on "[Custom Commands](https://yagpdb.xyz/manage/560140367362523136/customcommands)" in the left sidebar.
3. Copy and paste the custom command code that you want to import.
4. Repeat the above steps for each custom command that you want to add to your server.

## Usage
To use these custom commands, simply type the command in a text channel on your Discord server. The bot will then execute the command and respond with the result. The exact usage and syntax of each custom command may vary, so be sure to read the comments for each command before using it.
